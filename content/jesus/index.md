As child I grew up catholic and I remember myself as praying regularly, well knowing and sensing when I did things that were not good for me and against love. On the other side, I ever had issues with my sexuality and eventually fell into bad habbits at a very early age as child. Early I had several girlfriends and way too early I had my first sexual encounters. Further, I fell into drug habbits, smoked wheed and always was looking for freedom in my heart. When I was under alcoholic influence, I was a moron and sometimes treated people very unfair und unloving. I further started to play guitar in a band called Demon Seed, later they renamed to [Frozen Infinity](https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Frozen_Infinity/81415). The athmosphere in the band sessions were, let's say, weired. I would say, we were a bunch of young guys dreaming of some success and playing at some events, which at least for me, never happened. I went to high-school, did my degree and just lived with my inner emptiness and powerlessness. In 2007 I did my Civil Service and in the last month of that life period 
I had a dramatic motorcycle accident.

I nearly died and was very lucky to survive - a clear miracle. Nobody knew how I would end up. Anyhow, physical healing went incredibely fast. I instantly started to study Computer Science. My back then girlfriend went on a US travel and I would say, I turned her trip to a real nightmare and hell on earth. Not intentionally, I just was so traumatized and something inside of me tormented me with a unnatural and completely unlogical fear of loosing her. In 2008 she quit the relationship, which was brutal to me. Consequently, I decided to start to train my body and to go into some healing process. On a tour to Padua in Italy, I remember myself sitting in a church, crying to God staring at the cross of Jesus. I wanted her back and it hurt so much. Unfortunately, nothing happened into that direction. At the same time, I read the book `The Art of Loving` from Erich Fromm. I tried to start to love people out of myself and the effects were amazing. Unfortunately, I quickly went out of love (the fuel of the human soul) and I turned to be a selfish, cold hearted human being in the proceeding years. I guess this was the turning point when **I slowly decided that God does not exists**. The society and humans started to piss me off and I hat much hatred inside my heart. I hoped to find freedom in another country. My new girlfriend and I decided to study abroad in Canada - but in different towns. She in Ottawa and I in Toronto. I lived outside of town and got so depressed that I did not know what to do. Blaming everybody and trying to grasp everything that could hold me, I wanted to travel back to Germany. As I wanted to travel around after the terms and my flat in Germany was sublet, I decided to stay in Canada and fight it through. After I changed the University to Kingston it became better, but still wasn't amazing. I was empty inside as never before and did not know how to solve this issue. Again I turned the life of my girlfriend into a nightmare. Consequently, she betrayed me when someone made her very drunk. I utterly wanted to forgive her, but I couldn't. When we travelled around it was a pure nightmare for her, I would say.

When I came back to Germany in Summer 2013 after visiting a friend in Columbia, she broke up - understandably. It was a supernatural moment. When she broke up, I thought that I should cry and I tried in vain. Then I had sudden freedom and decided to get some food a bit farer away. I cycled there and met an old flatmate who invited me to come by for a beer. On the very same evening, I met my wife. She was a strong follower of Jesus and on that evening had a special visitor - an evangelical pastor - and living in the old flat where I was living years before. My wife and I became best friends and God started to show me his love through her. Although I was still trying to get my ex-girlfriend back, she started to attrack me and we eventually became a couple. 
Futhermore, when I came back from Canada, I started to be [active in politics](https://www.badische-zeitung.de/raphael-schmitt-freiburg--84511999.html) as I thought, we must care more about this planet. This good intend went into an unhealthy extrem. I started to life vegan and judge other people for destroying the planet. My back then girlfriend and todays wife accompanied me on that path but nevertheless my heart became harder and harder. I did not care about myself very much and ran around in weird old clotings.  For a period of time I even lived without a fridge. But all the effort I put into my lifestyle did not improve my inner status - no fullfillment, no peace, no freedom at all - quite the opposite.

In 2016, a few weeks after my wife prayed to Jesus, that she cannot life like that anymore and seriously wanted to brake up, I accepted Jesus as my Lord and saviour. She didn't tell me about that prayer - anyways I would probably have reacted very unloving. On one day she invited my flatmate, an agnostic, to join her for church service. At that point I was an [anti-theist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antitheism), convinced, that there is no God. I totally believed the idea that nothing created everything - which I can say as a scientist makes absolutely no sense. **It is scientifically seen just impossible that nothing created everything. Further, I even did not accept the fact, that a human consists of soul, body and spirit.** Anyways, when he said "Yes" I decided to join as well. I arrived later at the [church](https://cgfr.de) and thought these people are insane. Inside myself, everything was very dark and empty. I was arrogant when the preacher preached and thought "when he knew, what I know he would think differently" because I was scientifecly very educated. At the end the pastor asked the crowed if someone wants to try jesus. My friend raised his arm and so I did. We both prayed a sinners prayer. In the same night I had a very present dream, which was new to me. We started to follow Jesus, i.e. go to church services. Starting to read the Bible. On one day, both of us had an extreme encounter with the holy spirit, when an apostle and a prophet of the church prayed for us. In my case, I know today, that back then I lost some demons. On that day my friend and I knew, that Christ is Lord. In my heart I suddenly arrived at home and knew that this was what I was looking for my entire life. The filling **unconditional love** that I experienced was so extrem and completely unearned. Funny fact: we were looking for truth, as we saw all the lies in the world. Final destination was the objective truth, which is a person: `Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me`[^John16:04]. We completely didn't expect a person to be that truth. In August 2016 I became truly baptized, started to eat meet again and asked my wife to mary me. Continuing following Christ I more and more discovered his love, lost a lot of tears and got some of my emotions back. He furhter healed me from physical sicknesses and I didn't require that much sleep anymore (12h+ vs. 7-8h). Finally, in 2017 my wife and I married. But it wasn't all that easy, yet. I still suffered from various bad emotional outbreaks and was somehow manipulative.

In 2018 the holy spirit told me to fast some days, i.e. only drink water and eat nothing, and so I did. At that time [The Last Reformation](https://thelastreformation.com/) carried out an event in town and a friend of mine co-ordinated it. So I helped them as well, inviting people on the street to a cinema presentation of their [movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7iaTGXTEU0) and praying for the sick. In the evening of the that event, which was my second day fasting, a group of us went to a back yard and ate some pizza. Suddenly, the holy spirit started to work. People were freed from demons. After God worked through us (we touched somebody to pray, and he instantly fell on the ground), I had the feeling God wants to free me. When a couple of people prayed for me, commanding my demon out, the muskles on my entire back started to twist together as if someone was holding on it. With a loud shout the demon went out and I felt freedom. I was astonished, as there was more freedom, than I expected. I felt like loosing tons of weight. After that experience again a lot changed in my life happened: I was able to grow in love, I heard God more clearly as the fear just went and I didn't had to constantly fight against my old nature anymore. The doubtful voices which were in my head when God spoke to me, disappeared - I'm completely free now! That demon was all my life inside of me - one that required fast and prayer as Jesus told us thousands of years ago: `Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting`[^Mat17:21]. After being spiritual free, God started a process to work on my soul. I'm still in this process and this seems to be lifelong adventure which sets me more and more free and makes me to the human God once planned me to be.

Jesus is alive and you can encounter him. It is your decission to accept him as your God. You do not need to "believe" in the sense of hoping that it is true, what he did. He's going to start the faith as the Bible states it. He gives you the his holy spirit who re-establishes the relation to God the father. faith in the Bible is "trusting" and therefore you need to know him, have a relationship, i.e. encounter him. Before my flatmate and I experienced God, we once even said, it would be nice to have that believe that my wife has, but we simply cannot believe (in the sense of hoping) it. That was very clever, as it is not like that. I cannot even "believe" as the bible means it out of myself. Therefore, it is a decission and makes it much easier, it's a complete gift:
`Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith`[^Heb12:2].

How does it work? Jesus died, because we all sin (are morally far away from love). We lie, we steal, we use God's name in vain, are greedy, selfish and so forth. All that is called sin and is the root of evil. The root of sin is our heart. Fear is in our heart and we are not capable to love unconditionally as he does. The consequence of sin is death in the spirit and as God is spirit we are seperated from him. God and sin is not compatible, it would lead to death through astonishment. Therefore, he has to seperate himself from us.
This sounds very bad and it truly is. But the **one and only living God** is pure uncondontitional love and loves us so much, that he died for us and payed the fine. He became human in **Jesus Christ**. Jesus Christ raised from the dead and has the power to forgive and remove your sins. Now there comes your chance: You can ask Jesus Christ right now for forgiveness and to fill you with the holy spirit by a simple prayer. Just speak out loud with your lips and your mouth the following words:

`Jesus Christ, please forgive me all my sins and come into my life! Baptize me with the holy spirit and re-establish the relationship to my heavenly father. I accept you as my God and Saviour. Please make me to the human being you once planned me to be: an image of your perfect love. Remove all fear, hatred and darkness out of my life and free me now from every demonic power. In Jesus Name Amen.`

Steps to grow the relationship with God are prayer (talk to him), especially reading the [Bible](https://www.bibleserver.com/), I recommend to start with the New Testament, and also relationships with Christians. Next step is waterbaptism and I recommend to do it quick - it has some serious spiritual effects, trust me. You can contact somebody of [The Last Reformation](https://thelastreformation.com/). Also look for a local Bible based church that akknowledges Jesus Christ as God and saviour as it gives you guidance and spiritual protection. Jesus now gave you the power to see and overcome sin in your life, and most importantly to increase in love in order to become the human he once planned. He wants to restore you're heart and make you pulling heaven down to make this dark world a brighter place.

Now, it's the time to rest and let him do his work in you:

`Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. 
Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.
For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.
`[^Mat11:28-30]

God bless you!
