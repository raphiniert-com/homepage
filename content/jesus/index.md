## My Journey

{{< figure src="/img/hospital.jpg" caption="In the intensive care unit of the University Hospital in Freiburg after a heavy motor cycle accident in 2007." class="floatleft" >}}

During my childhood, I adhered to Catholicism, regularly engaging in prayer and developing a keen sense of right and wrong. However, my early exposure to relationships and sexuality led me down a path of bad habits, drug use, and a quest for personal freedom. Despite achieving academic success, I grappled with inner emptiness and powerlessness.

A dramatic motorcycle accident, which nearly claimed my life, served as a turning point. Despite a swift physical recovery, I struggled emotionally. In 2007, I embarked on a journey into Computer Science, but my personal life took a toll. A tumultuous relationship and an intense focus on environmentalism and [politics](https://www.badische-zeitung.de/raphael-schmitt-freiburg--84511999.html) drove me further into emptiness turning me into a [anti-theist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antitheism).

Returning to Germany in 2013 after an accademic exchange year in Canada, I faced a breakup with my girl friend, followed by a supernatural moment. A chance encounter on the very same day led me to my future wife, a devout Christian, and through her, I began to experience God's love. In 2016, after a period of introspection and spiritual exploration, I and my flatmate had an encounter with God. Consequently, I accepted Jesus as my Lord and Savior. This transformative experience brought about emotional healing, and I felt a profound sense of home and inner peace for the first time.

The subsequent years were marked by spiritual growth, baptism, and marriage in 2017. However, the journey wasn't without challenges. Besides, God showed me that Satan and Demons exist, especially in a pivotal moment in 2018. Inspired by the Holy Spirit, I undertook a fast, and during an event by [The Last Reformation](https://thelastreformation.com/), experienced deliverance from a lingering demon[^Mat17:21]. After a group of Christians prayed for me, with one scream something left me, after it tried to hold on my inner side of the back - a pretty strange moment. This encounter brought an unprecedented level of freedom, lifting a weight that had burdened me throughout my life.

Since then, I've continued to evolve spiritually, navigating the lifelong adventure of self-discovery and alignment with God's plan. Each step forward brings me closer to the person God intended me to be, gradually setting me free from the shackles of my past. God walked a path of inner healing with me. Jesus goes to the roots: he is constantly changing my heart and thus is changing me from the inside out. God encountered me repeatedly and regardless of my circumstances, I have freedom in my struggles and can always turn to him. As if I had been a tree far away in the desert, I am now provided by water that never runs dry[^John4:14].
 

## Your Chance to Encounter God

Encounter the living Jesus by seeking and eventually accepting Him as your God and Savior[^Luke11:9]. Faith is a decision, not just a belief. Jesus initiates faith, providing the Holy Spirit to restore your relationship with father God[^Heb12:2]. Acknowledge that you can't save yourself by good deeds[^Ephesians2:8-9]; we all need the grace of God. He does not condem us, but came to rescue us. All he wants is a loving relationship with us that fills our hearts and blesses us so that we can leave the paths of destruction that Satan leads us down.

### What Jesus did

Jesus died for our sins, breaking the cycle of destructive "dead gods." Sin, the root of evil, separates us from God and leads to spiritual death. This forms an infinite whole in our hearts, which we try to cope with in so many ways and which ultimately drives us to self-destruction and tyranny. Jesus, the one true God[^John16:04], demonstrated unconditional love by dying for us, rising from the dead, and forgiving our sins. He payed our dept, as the wage of sin is death. Only the acceptance of Christ's offering can re-establish our relationship to the living God who is the only one being able to fullfill our hearts. Apart from the present state, we live forever, and it is up to us to choose whether we want eternal life with God or separation from Him[^Romans6:23] - so choose wisely.

You can ask Jesus now for forgiveness and invite the Holy Spirit into your life through a simple prayer. Pray aloud:

```Jesus Christ, forgive my sins, come into my life, baptize me with the Holy Spirit. I accept you as my God and Savior. Transform me into an image of your perfect love, removing fear and darkness. Free me from any demonic powers, heal me and demonstrate me your unconditional love. Implement your heavenly kingdom into me! Amen.```

If you prayed it, grow your relationship with God through prayer, reading the Bible, and water baptism. Seek guidance from [The Last Reformation](https://map.thelastreformation.com) and find a local Bible-based church. Let God work in you and bring light to this world. Rest in His promise: ```Come to me, all who labor, and I will give you rest. My yoke is easy, and my burden is light```[^Mat11:28-30]. 

If you are not yet ready to make a decision, I definitely recommend that you seek the Lord. Pick up a Bible or [read it online](https://www.bibleserver.com). Best, start with the New Testament. Have the courage to ask Jesus to show you his existence. Also, I highly recommend the [Alpha Course](https://alpha.org/) to learn more about the Christian faith in a community which enables you to have direct conversations and ask questions. Finally, I pray that the Lord will reveal Himself to you.

God bless you!
