abstract: Activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) δ Syndrome (APDS), caused by
  autosomal dominant mutations in PIK3CD (APDS1) or PIK3R1 (APDS2), is a heterogeneous
  primary immunodeficiency. While initial cohort-descriptions summarized the spectrum
  of clinical and immunological manifestations, questions about long-term disease
  evolution and response to therapy remain. The prospective European Society for Immunodeficiencies
  (ESID)-APDS registry aims to characterize the disease course, identify outcome predictors,
  and evaluate treatment responses. So far, 77 patients have been recruited (51 APDS1,
  26 APDS2). Analysis of disease evolution in the first 68 patients pinpoints the
  early occurrence of recurrent respiratory infections followed by chronic lymphoproliferation,
  gastrointestinal manifestations, and cytopenias. Although most manifestations occur
  by age 15, adult-onset and asymptomatic courses were documented. Bronchiectasis
  was observed in 24/40 APDS1 patients who received a CT-scan compared with 4/15 APDS2
  patients. By age 20, half of the patients had received at least one immunosuppressant,
  but 2-3 lines of immunosuppressive therapy were not unusual before age 10. Response
  to rapamycin was rated by physician visual analog scale as good in 10, moderate
  in 9, and poor in 7. Lymphoproliferation showed the best response (8 complete, 11
  partial, 6 no remission), while bowel inflammation (3 complete, 3 partial, 9 no
  remission) and cytopenia (3 complete, 2 partial, 9 no remission) responded less
  well. Hence, non-lymphoproliferative manifestations should be a key target for novel
  therapies. This report from the ESID-APDS registry provides comprehensive baseline
  documentation for a growing cohort that will be followed prospectively to establish
  prognostic factors and identify patients for treatment studies.
