abstract: '(1) Background: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of patients with advanced
  tumors is becoming an established method in Molecular Tumor Boards. However, somatic
  variant detection, interpretation, and report generation, require in-depth knowledge
  of both bioinformatics and oncology. (2) Methods: MIRACUM-Pipe combines many individual
  tools into a seamless workflow for comprehensive analyses and annotation of NGS
  data including quality control, alignment, variant calling, copy number variation
  estimation, evaluation of complex biomarkers, and RNA fusion detection. (3) Results:
  MIRACUM-Pipe offers an easy-to-use, one-prompt standardized solution to analyze
  NGS data, including quality control, variant calling, copy number estimation, annotation,
  visualization, and report generation. (4) Conclusions: MIRACUM-Pipe, a versatile
  pipeline for NGS, can be customized according to bioinformatics and clinical needs
  and to support clinical decision-making with visual processing and interactive reporting.'
