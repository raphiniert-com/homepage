 abstract = {Data extraction, visualization and distribution is an important task in the daily work of a database management team. In the medical field requests are often made by researchers who use spreadsheet programs such as Excel. Thus, we developed a framework which allows us to extract database tables with 1:N relations in a sparse spreadsheet which prevents redundant information. The Framework is implemented in PHP using a JSON interface. Further, we offer connectors for a direct connection to a Postgres database.},
