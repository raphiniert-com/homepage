abstract: Data extraction, visualization and distribution is an important task in
  the daily work of a database management team. In the medical field requests are
  often made by researchers who use spreadsheet programs such as Excel. Thus, we developed
  a framework which allows us to extract database tables with 1:N relations in a sparse
  spreadsheet which prevents redundant information. The Framework is implemented in
  PHP using a JSON interface. Further, we offer connectors for a direct connection
  to a Postgres database.
