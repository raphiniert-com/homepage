abstract: 'Background:  The German Network on Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases (PID-NET)
  utilizes the European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID) registry as a platform
  for collecting data. In the context of PID-NET data, we show how registries based
  on custom software can be made interoperable for better collaborative access to
  precollected data.  The Open Source Registry System for Rare Diseases ( Open-Source-Registersystem
  für Seltene Erkrankungen  [OSSE], in German) provides patient organizations, physicians,
  scientists, and other parties with open source software for the creation of patient
  registries. In addition, the necessary interoperability between different registries
  based on the OSSE, as well as existing registries, is supported, which allows those
  registries to be confederated at both the national and international levels. Objective:  Data
  from the PID-NET registry should be made available in an interoperable manner without
  losing data sovereignty by extending the existing custom software of the registry
  using the OSSE registry framework. Methods:  This paper describes the following:
  (1) the installation and configuration of the OSSE bridgehead, (2) an approach using
  a free toolchain to set up the required interfaces to connect a registry with the
  OSSE bridgehead, and (3) the decentralized search,  which allows the formulation
  of inquiries that are sent to a selected set of registries of interest. Results:  PID-NET
  uses the established and highly customized ESID registry software. By setting up
  a so-called OSSE bridgehead, PID-NET data are made interoperable according to a
  federated approach, and centrally formulated inquiries for data can be received.
  As the first registry to use the OSSE bridgehead, the authors introduce an approach
  using a free toolchain to efficiently implement and maintain the required interfaces.
  Finally, to test and demonstrate the system, two inquiries are realized using the
  graphical query builder. By establishing and interconnecting an OSSE bridgehead
  with the underlying ESID registry, confederated queries for data can be received
  and, if desired, the inquirer can be contacted to further discuss any requirements
  for cooperation. Conclusions:  The OSSE offers an infrastructure that provides the
  possibility of more collaborative and transparent research. The decentralized search
  functionality includes registries into one search application while still maintaining
  data sovereignty. The OSSE bridgehead enables any registry software to be integrated
  into the OSSE network. The proposed toolchain to set up the required interfaces
  consists of freely available software components that are well documented. The use
  of the decentralized search is uncomplicated to use and offers a well-structured,
  yet still improvable, graphical user interface to formulate queries. [JMIR Med Inform
