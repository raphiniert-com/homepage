abstract: Patient registries are instrumental for clinical research in rare diseases.
  They help to achieve a sufficient sample size for epidemiological and clinical research
  and to assess the feasibility of clinical trials. The European Society for Immunodeficiencies
  (ESID) registry currently comprises information on more than 25,000 patients with
  inborn errors of immunity (IEI). The prerequisite of a patient to be included into
  the ESID registry is an IEI either defined by a defect in a gene included in the
  disease classification of the international union of immunological societies, or
  verified by applying clinical criteria. Because a relevant number of patients, including
  those with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), representing the largest group
  of patients in the registry, remain without a genetic diagnosis, consensus on classification
  of these patients is mandatory. Here, we present clinical criteria for a large number
  of IEI that were designed in expert panels with an external review. They were implemented
  for novel entries and verification of existing data sets from 2014, yielding a substantial
  refinement. For instance, 8% of adults and 27% of children with CVID (176 of 1704
  patients) were reclassified to 22 different immunodeficiencies, illustrating progress
  in genetics, but also the previous lack of standardized disease definitions. Importantly,
  apart from registry purposes, the clinical criteria are also helpful to support
  treatment decisions in the absence of a genetic diagnosis or in patients with variants
  of unknown significance.
