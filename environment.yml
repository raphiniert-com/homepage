  # Hugo Extended is required to compile SCSS/SASS (TOCSS). The conda-forge
  # channel does not always publish a `hugo-extended` package for every
  # release. If `hugo-extended` is unavailable, install the regular `hugo`
  # package and run `./scripts/install-hugo-extended.sh` (provided) to
  # replace the binary in the active conda env with the official Extended
  # build.
