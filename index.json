Other conditions sharing these manifestations have been termed “ALPS-like”, although they are frequently more severe. Insufficient information on the genetic, clinical and immunological features of these disorders renders their diagnostic classification and treatment difficult.Methods: We performed a 14-year prospective study on 431 children referred for ALPS evaluation with lymphoproliferation and autoimmune cytopenia (n=236), lymphoproliferation and another sign of an inborn error of immunity (SoIEI) (n=148), or (bi)-autoimmune cytopenia and SoIEI (n=47). ALPS biomarkers were determined in all. Sequencing depth was recommended by the study team and IEI panel, exome or genome sequencing were performed as decided by the treating physician in 240 patients.Results: ALPS was diagnosed in 71 patients. CD38+CD45RA+ double negative T cells phenotyping did not outcompete sFASL/vitaminB12 as most predictive biomarkers. Fifty-four patients had mostly autosomal-dominant autoimmune-lymphoproliferative immunodeficiencies (AD-ALPID) affecting JAK/STAT, CTLA4/LRBA, PI3K, NFkB or RAS signaling. Sixteen patients had somatic mutations. Nineteen had other IEI, 17 other diagnoses and 79 no diagnosis despite extended genetics (ALPID-U). Multivariate clustering of clinical and laboratory manifestations did not discriminate ALPID-U from AD-ALPID, but ALPID-U patients had later onset and 80% were male. Re-classification of patients fulfilling CVID or Evans syndrome criteria did not increase the proportion of genetic diagnoses.Conclusion: The ALPID phenotype defined here is enriched for patients with genetic diseases treatable with targeted therapies. The term ALPID may be useful to direct diagnostic and therapeutic efforts also for some children currently classified as CVID or Evans syndrome.Funding: This study was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft under Germany’s Excellence Strategy (CIBSS—EXC-21899—Project ID 390939984; SE), the SFB1160 (TPA08) and the BMBF-funded German Auto-Immunity Network (GAIN), grant code 197 01GM1910A (BG, SE, FH).

We present an approach that can save this effort and assess its query performance in a case study that reflects real-world scenarios.For data segregation, we used PostgreSQL’s row level security (RLS) feature, the unit test framework pgTAP for validation and testing as well as the i2b2 application. No change of the i2b2 code was required. Instead, to leverage orchestration and deployment, we additionally implemented a command line interface (CLI). We evaluated performance using 3 different queries generated by i2b2, which we performed on an enlarged Harvard demo dataset.We introduce the open source Python CLI i2b2rls, which orchestrates and manages security roles to implement data marts so that they do not need to be replicated and synchronized as different i2b2 projects. Our evaluation showed that our approach is on average 3.55 and on median 2.71 times slower compared to classic i2b2 data marts, but has more flexibility and easier setup.The RLS-based approach is particularly useful in a scenario with many projects, where data is constantly updated, user and group requirements change frequently or complex user authorization requirements have to be defined. The approach applies to both the i2b2 interface and direct database access.Today, data warehouses form the foundation of modern data science in all areas where insights are gained from data. In the medical and healthcare sector, these warehouses require data access rules. i2b2 is a prominent and widespread data warehouse software providing project specific data segregation and thus access management. However, i2b2’s current approach often involves data replication and synchronization, leading to significant effort. Based on the main components shipped within i2b2 and their features, we present a command line tool which orchestrates a new data segregation approach without the requirement of data replication which we released under MIT open source license. Additionally, we evaluated our approach’s performance using 3 different queries on a real-world warehouse scenario based on a pre-existent enlarged demo dataset of i2b2. Our evaluation showed that our approach is on average 3.55 and on median 2.71 times slower compared to classic i2b2 approach but has more flexibility and easier setup.

Management depends on disease evolution, but predictors of severe disease are lacking. Objectives Report the extended spectrum of disease manifestations in APDS1 versus APDS2, compare these to CTLA-4 deficiency, NFκB1 deficiency, and STAT3 gain-of-function (GOF) disease; identify predictors of severity in APDS. Methods Data collection with the European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID)-APDS registry. Comparison with published cohorts of the other IEIs. Results The analysis of 170 APDS patients outlines high penetrance and early-onset of APDS compared to the other IEIs. The large clinical heterogeneity even in individuals with the same PIK3CD variant E1021K illustrates how poorly the genotype predicts the disease phenotype and course. The high clinical overlap between APDS and the other investigated IEIs suggests relevant pathophysiological convergence of the affected pathways. Preferentially affected organ systems indicate specific pathophysiology: bronchiectasis is typical of APDS1; interstitial lung disease and enteropathy are more common in STAT3 GOF and CTLA-4 deficiency. Endocrinopathies are most frequent in STAT3 GOF, but growth impairment is also common particularly in APDS2. Early clinical presentation is a risk factor for severe disease in APDS. Conclusion APDS illustrates how a single genetic variant can result in a diverse autoimmune-lymphoproliferative phenotype. Overlap with other IEI is substantial. Some specific features distinguish APDS1 from APDS2. Early-onset is a risk factor for severe disease course calling for specific treatment studies in younger patients.","tags":["APDS","CTLA-4","ESID","IEI","immunodeficiency","NFκB1","PI3K","PIK3CD","PIK3R1","STAT3"],"title":"Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase δ Syndrome: Update from the ESID Registry and comparison with other autoimmune-lymphoproliferative inborn errors of immunity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Raphael Scheible","David Alkier","Justus Wendroth","Julian Mayer","Martin Boeker"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"91adcdc573350c1046afd02ebb3db6ab","permalink":"https://raphiniert.com/publication/scheible-fhir-2023/","publishdate":"2023-12-29T21:27:16.985409Z","relpermalink":"/publication/scheible-fhir-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"FHIR DataProvider for ReactAdmin: Leveraging User Interface Creation for Medical Web Applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Raphael Scheible","Stephan Rusch","Maria Elena Maccari","Markus G.

The introduction of Bidirectional Encoders for Transformers (BERT) and its optimized version RoBERTa have had significant impact and increased the relevance of pre-trained models. First, research in this field mainly started on English data followed by models trained with multilingual text corpora. However, current research shows that multilingual models are inferior to monolingual models. Currently, no German single language RoBERTa model is yet published, which we introduce in this work (GottBERT). The German portion of the OSCAR data set was used as text corpus. In an evaluation we compare its performance on the two Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks Conll 2003 and GermEval 2014 as well as on the text classification tasks GermEval 2018 (fine and coarse) and GNAD with existing German single language BERT models and two multilingual ones. GottBERT was pre-trained related to the original RoBERTa model using fairseq. All downstream tasks were trained using hyperparameter presets taken from the benchmark of German BERT. The experiments were setup utilizing FARM. Performance was measured by the $F_1$ score. GottBERT was successfully pre-trained on a 256 core TPU pod using the RoBERTa BASE architecture. Even without extensive hyper-parameter optimization, in all NER and one text classification task, GottBERT already outperformed all other tested German and multilingual models.

In the context of PID-NET data, we show how registries based on custom software can be made interoperable for better collaborative access to precollected data.  The Open Source Registry System for Rare Diseases ( Open-Source-Registersystem für Seltene Erkrankungen  [OSSE], in German) provides patient organizations, physicians, scientists, and other parties with open source software for the creation of patient registries. In addition, the necessary interoperability between different registries based on the OSSE, as well as existing registries, is supported, which allows those registries to be confederated at both the national and international levels. Objective:  Data from the PID-NET registry should be made available in an interoperable manner without losing data sovereignty by extending the existing custom software of the registry using the OSSE registry framework. Methods:  This paper describes the following: (1) the installation and configuration of the OSSE bridgehead, (2) an approach using a free toolchain to set up the required interfaces to connect a registry with the OSSE bridgehead, and (3) the decentralized search,  which allows the formulation of inquiries that are sent to a selected set of registries of interest. Results:  PID-NET uses the established and highly customized ESID registry software. By setting up a so-called OSSE bridgehead, PID-NET data are made interoperable according to a federated approach, and centrally formulated inquiries for data can be received. As the first registry to use the OSSE bridgehead, the authors introduce an approach using a free toolchain to efficiently implement and maintain the required interfaces. Finally, to test and demonstrate the system, two inquiries are realized using the graphical query builder. By establishing and interconnecting an OSSE bridgehead with the underlying ESID registry, confederated queries for data can be received and, if desired, the inquirer can be contacted to further discuss any requirements for cooperation. Conclusions:  The OSSE offers an infrastructure that provides the possibility of more collaborative and transparent research. The decentralized search functionality includes registries into one search application while still maintaining data sovereignty. The OSSE bridgehead enables any registry software to be integrated into the OSSE network. The proposed toolchain to set up the required interfaces consists of freely available software components that are well documented.

On the other side, I ever had issues with my sexuality and eventually fell into bad habbits at a very early age as child. Early I had several girlfriends and way too early I had my first sexual encounters. Further, I fell into drug habbits, smoked weed and always was looking for freedom in my heart. When I was under alcoholic influence, I was a moron and sometimes treated people very unfair und unloving. I further started to play guitar in a band called Demon Seed, later they renamed to Frozen Infinity. The athmosphere in the band sessions were, let\u0026rsquo;s say, weired. I would say, we were a bunch of young guys dreaming of some success and playing at some events, which at least for me, never happened. I went to high-school, did my degree and just lived with my inner emptiness and powerlessness. In 2007 I did my Civil Service and in the last month of that life period I had a dramatic motorcycle accident.\n  In the intensive care unit of the University Hospital in Freiburg after a heavy motor cycle accident in 2007.   I nearly died and was very lucky to survive - a clear miracle. Nobody knew how I would end up. Anyhow, physical healing went incredibely fast. I instantly started to study Computer Science. My girlfriend at that time went on a US travel and I would say, I turned her trip to a real nightmare and hell on earth. Not intentionally, I just was so traumatized and something inside of me tormented me with a unnatural and completely unlogical fear of loosing her. In 2008 she quit the relationship, which was brutal to me. Consequently, I decided to start to train my body and to go into some healing process, i.e. psychologist sessions. On a tour to Padua in Italy, I remember myself sitting in a church, crying to God staring at the cross of Jesus. I wanted her back and it hurt so much and I wanted my emptyness to go away. Unfortunately, nothing happened into that direction. At the same time, I read the book The Art of Loving from Erich Fromm and afterwards I tried to start to love people out of myself. The effects were amazing, as relationsships grew. Unfortunately, I quickly went out of energy, out of love (the fuel of the human soul) and I turned to be a selfish, cold hearted human being in the proceeding years. I guess this was the turning point when I slowly decided that God does not exists. The society and humans started to piss me off and I hat much hatred inside my heart. I hoped to find freedom in another country. My new girlfriend and I decided to study abroad in Canada - but in different towns. She in Ottawa and I in Toronto. I lived outside of town. Here I was confronted with the hole in my heart and away from my usual life with my hole filling techniques were gone. Nothing seemed to help and consequently I got so depressed that I did not know what else to do. Blaming everybody and trying to grasp everything that could hold me, I wanted to travel back to Germany. But as I originally planned to travel around after the terms and my flat in Germany was sublet, I decided to stay in Canada and fight it through. After I changed the University to Kingston it became better, but still wasn\u0026rsquo;t amazing. I was empty inside as never before and still did not know how to solve this issue. Sports didn\u0026rsquo;t work, sex didn\u0026rsquo;t work, concentrated working wasn\u0026rsquo;t possible at all and drugs didn\u0026rsquo;t solve this issue. Again I turned the life of my girlfriend into a nightmare. Consequently, she betrayed me when someone made her very drunk. I utterly wanted to forgive her, but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t as cold hearted as I was. When we travelled around it was a pure nightmare for her, I would say.\nWhen I came back to Germany in Summer 2013 after visiting a friend in Columbia, she broke up - understandably. It was a supernatural moment. When she broke up, I thought that I should cry and I tried in vain. Then I had sudden freedom and decided to get some food a bit farer away. I cycled there and met an old flatmate who invited me to come by for a beer. On the very same evening, I met my wife. She was and still is a strong follower of Jesus and on that evening had a special visitor - an evangelical pastor - and living in the old flat where I was living years before. My wife and I became best friends and God started to show me his love through her. Although I was still trying to get my ex-girlfriend back, she started to attract me and we eventually became a couple. Futhermore, when I came back from Canada, I started to be active in politics as I thought, we must care more about this planet. This good intend went into an unhealthy extreme. I started to life vegan and judge other people for destroying the planet. My back then girlfriend and todays wife accompanied me on that path. Despite my good intentions, my heart became harder and harder. I did not care about myself very much and ran around in weird old clothings. For a period of time I even lived without a fridge. But all the effort I put into my lifestyle did not improve my inner status - no fulfillment, no peace, no freedom at all - quite the opposite.\n  Me in my vegan lifestyle period in 2014.   In 2016, a few weeks after my wife prayed to Jesus, that she cannot live like that anymore and seriously wanted to brake up, I accepted Jesus as my Lord and saviour (she didn\u0026rsquo;t tell me about that prayer): On one day she invited my flatmate, an agnostic, to join her for church service. At that point I was an anti-theist, convinced, that there is no God. I totally believed the idea that nothing created everything - which I can say as a scientist makes absolutely no sense. It is scientifically just impossible that nothing created everything. Further, I even did not accept the fact, that a human consists of soul, body and spirit. Furthermore, I was very narcistic and arrogant personality. I thought to have everything: nice girlfriend, good job and was convinced everything was going good in my life. Anyways, when my flatmate confirmed to join for church service, I decided to join as well. I joined them later at the church when service already started. Entering the church I thought these people are insane: Singing and rasing their arms, like they\u0026rsquo;re really feeling and something. Inside myself, everything was very dark and empty. When the preacher preached, I thought very arrogantly \u0026ldquo;when he knew, what I know he would think differently\u0026rdquo; because I was scientifecly very educated. At the end ot the service the pastor asked the crowd if someone wants to try Jesus. My friend raised his arm and so I did. We both went to the pastor and prayed a \u0026ldquo;sinners prayer\u0026rdquo;. When I spoke out, that I\u0026rsquo;m a sinner I honestly thought in my heart \u0026ldquo;indeed, I didn\u0026rsquo;t do everything right\u0026rdquo;. In the same night I had a very present dream, which was new to me. We started to follow Jesus, i.e. go to church services. Starting to read the Bible and things slowly changed inside of us. On one day, both of us had an extreme encounter with the holy spirit, when an apostle and a prophet of the church prayed for us. In my case, as I know today, back then I lost some demons. On that very day my friend and I knew, that Christ is Lord and the way to go. In my heart I suddenly arrived at some state I would call \u0026ldquo;home\u0026rdquo; and knew that I was looking for my entire life for that. The filling unconditional love that hit me the first time in that moment was so extrem and completely unearned. Funny fact: we were looking for truth, as we saw all the lies in the world. Final destination was the objective truth, which is a person, i.e. Jesus Christ: Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me1. We completely didn\u0026rsquo;t expect that. In August 2016 I became truly baptized, started to eat meet again and asked my wife to mary me. Continuing following Christ more and more I discovered his love, lost a lot of tears and got some of my emotions back. He furhter healed me from physical sicknesses and I didn\u0026rsquo;t require that much sleep anymore (12h+ vs. 7-8h). Finally, in 2017 my wife and I married.\n  Wedding shooting in 2017. Before I encoutered God, I never wanted to marry or even wearing a suite like that.   After my conversion to Jesus Christ, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t all that easy, yet. I still suffered from various bad emotional outbreaks and was somehow manipulative. In 2018 the holy spirit told me to fast a couple of days, i.e. only drink water and eat nothing, and so I did. At that time The Last Reformation carried out an event in town and a friend of mine co-ordinated it. So I helped them as well, inviting people on the street to a cinema presentation of their movie. In the evening of the that event, which was my second day fasting, a group of us went to a back yard and ate some pizza. Suddenly, the holy spirit started to work. People were freed from demons. After God worked through us (we touched somebody to pray, and he instantly fell on the ground), I had the feeling God wants to free me. When a couple of people prayed for me, i.e. commanding my demon out, the muscles on my entire back started to twist together as if someone inside or me was holding on it. With a loud shout the demon went out and I instantly felt freedom. I was astonished, as there was more freedom, than I already experienced. I felt like loosing tons of weight. After that experience again a lot changes in my life happened: I was able to grow in love, I heard God more clearly as the fear just went and I didn\u0026rsquo;t had to constantly fight against my old nature anymore. The doubtful voices which were in my head, especially when God spoke to me, disappeared - I became free at the 5. May 2018! That demon was all my life inside of me - one that required fast and prayer as Jesus told us thousands of years ago: Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting2. After being spiritual free, God started a process to work on my soul. I\u0026rsquo;m still in this process and this seems to be lifelong adventure which sets me more and more free and makes me to the human God once planned me to be.\n  Jesus is alive and you can encounter him. It is your decission to accept him as your God and saivor. You do not need to \u0026ldquo;believe\u0026rdquo; in the sense of hoping that it is true, what he did. He is the one who is going to start the faith as the Bible states it - but only by request. He gives you the holy spirit who re-establishes the relation to God the father. Faith in the Bible is \u0026ldquo;trusting\u0026rdquo; and therefore you need to know him - have a relationship, i.e. encounter him. Before my flatmate and I experienced God, we once said \u0026ldquo;it would be nice to have that believe but we simply cannot believe it\u0026rdquo;. That was very smart, as we humans even cannot believe out of our own as the Bible states. Therefore, it is a decission and makes it much easier and is based on maximal grace. It\u0026rsquo;s a complete gift which we can request from Jesus: Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith3.\n  How does it work? Jesus died, because we all sin (are morally far away from what the Bible defines as love). We lie, we steel, we use God\u0026rsquo;s name in vain, are greedy, jealous, envy, proud, selfish and so forth. Therefore, we follow dead Gods based on success, harmony, safety, fun and reputation. These dead gods always want offering, that never suffices. They keep wanting more and more while destroying you. When we act against the moral law of God, it is called sin. Sin is the root of evil. Sin defiles our heart. Sin let\u0026rsquo;s enter fear into our character as we lose our identity and purpose. The consequence of sin is death in the spirit and as God is spirit we are separated from him. God and sin is not compatible, it would lead to death through astonishment. Therefore, when sin entered the world, he had to seperate himself from us. The emptiness in our soul is the consequence. Apart from God, trying to fill this inner vacuum, we destroy ourselves, our loved ones and our surroundings. This sounds very bad and it truly is. In this state, we are not capable to love unconditionally as Jesus Christ does. But the one and only living God is pure uncondontitional love and loves humanity so much, that he died for us and payed the fine. He became human in Jesus Christ. When he died completely sinless on the cross, he payed for everybody who accepts this perfect offering. In order to prove, that he is god, Jesus Christ raised from the dead. He is still alive and has the power to forgive and remove your sins. He can give you a new heart. Now there comes your chance: You can ask Jesus Christ right now for forgiveness and to fill you with the holy spirit by a simple prayer. Just speak out loud with your lips and your mouth the following words:\nJesus Christ, please forgive me all my sins and come into my life! Baptize me with the holy spirit and re-establish the relationship to my heavenly father. I accept you as my God and Saviour. Please make me to the human being you once planned me to be: an image of your perfect love. Please give me a new loving heart and remove all fear, hatred and darkness out of my life and free me now from every demonic power. In Jesus name - Amen.\nSteps to grow your relationship with God are prayer (talk to him) and especially reading the Bible. I recommend to start with the New Testament. Next step is water baptism and I recommend to do it quick - it has some serious spiritual effects, trust me! You can contact somebody of The Last Reformation. Also look for a local Bible based church that acknowledges Jesus Christ as God and saviour as it gives you guidance and spiritual protection. Jesus now gave you the power to see and overcome sin in your life, and most importantly to increase in love (as the Bible defines it) in order to become the human God once planned. God wants to restore you\u0026rsquo;re heart and make you pulling heaven down to make this dark world a brighter place.\nNow, it\u0026rsquo;s the time to rest and let him do his work in you:\nCome unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. 4\nGod bless you!\nWatch the following movie to see what God is still doing through his desciples today:    The Bible, John 14:6 ^ The Bible, Matthew 14:21 ^ The Bible, Hebrews 12:2 ^ The Bible, Matthew 11:28-13 ^   ","date":1577566920,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577566920,"objectID":"47734519599918f2fd76e1a729191523","permalink":"https://raphiniert.com/jesus/","publishdate":"2019-12-28T22:02:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/jesus/","section":"","summary":"How I met the one and only living God","tags":["Godly encounter","Jesus Christ","Unconditional Love"],"title":"Spiritual Life","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Bioinformatics"],"content":"","date":1577555479,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577555479,"objectID":"47a2efa415310fe109a204c0410ea396","permalink":"https://raphiniert.com/project/miracum-pipe/","publishdate":"2019-12-28T18:51:19+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/miracum-pipe/","section":"project","summary":"Whole exome sequencing pipeline including advanced variant annotation features and automated PDF reporting.","tags":["Bioinformatics","Genetic Sequencing"],"title":"Miracum Pipe","type":"project"},{"authors":["Markus G.

The core application is implemented in C/C++. To guarantee fast computations the render process computes on the GPU. This is realized by NVIDIA® CUDA®. Furthermore Volume Renderer for use with MATLAB® provides the following features:\n Special memory management: Due to restricted GPU memory and the requirement to render more than one volume in one scene, we developed a special memory management to enable the rendering of huge data sets in separate rendering passes. Afterward these separately rendered images are combined to one image using MATLAB®. Generic illumination model: We developed a generic illumination model that is easy to extend with other illumination functions. The provided function is the Heneyey-Greenstein phase function. Stereo rendering: In some use cases there is a nice feature to work with stereo images. Thus, the renderer offers the possibility to render off-axis stereo images. High usability: To enable a high usability a MATLAB® interface consisting of several MATLAB® classes has been developed. Due to this interface it is uncomplicated to generate movies.  More detailed explanation of the renderer and its background can be found in the documentation in the download section. We provide this software only for 64 bit Linux systems.\nIt was developed by Raphael Scheible supervised by Benjamin Ummenhofer and Junior-Prof Dr. Olaf Ronneberger and is maintained by Raphael Scheible.\nRequirements  CUDA® capable NVIDIA® graphics device\n(at least Fermi™ architecture) Linux computer (64 bit) with installed NVIDIA® driver and CUDA® 4.2 MATLAB® (*)  * tested and developed under R2010a; might work from 2009a as the OOP feature was introduced the renderer uses.\nExample The following video demonstrates the power of the renderer.\nprovided by Benjamin Ummenhofer, data from [1]\n  Download  Documentation: documentation-1.0.pdf\nmd5sum: 5af53f26fe5965eb7ac9d69a2c0050be Software: vrm-1.0.tar.gz\nmd5sum: f324f09f3b7845876e5caf50a71b2f12  Installation Copy the files of src/matlab/ and bin/ into your current working folder. From this locationyou can now easily call the renderer.\nIf you want to compile src/HeneyeyGreenstein.cc by yourself, use themex command in your MATLAB® environment:\nmex inputfile -output resultname\nFor a more detailed explanation of the mex command visit this website .\nAlternatively, you can use the HG.mexa64. This provides the command to build alookup table for the illumination setup. This is a compiled version of HeneyeyGrennstein.cc.\nIf you want to write your own illumination function, you can adaptHeneyeyGrennstein.cc accordingly.\nLicence The provided matlab code and C-code for building the Heneyey-Greenstein LUT are released under New BSD License .\nThe matlab binary files (render command and binary of Heneyey-Greenstein.h) are relesed under the following license:\nCopyright © 2012, Raphael Scheible All rights reserved.
