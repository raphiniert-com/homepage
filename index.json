Other conditions sharing these manifestations have been termed “ALPS-like”, although they are frequently more severe. Insufficient information on the genetic, clinical and immunological features of these disorders renders their diagnostic classification and treatment difficult.Methods: We performed a 14-year prospective study on 431 children referred for ALPS evaluation with lymphoproliferation and autoimmune cytopenia (n=236), lymphoproliferation and another sign of an inborn error of immunity (SoIEI) (n=148), or (bi)-autoimmune cytopenia and SoIEI (n=47). ALPS biomarkers were determined in all. Sequencing depth was recommended by the study team and IEI panel, exome or genome sequencing were performed as decided by the treating physician in 240 patients.Results: ALPS was diagnosed in 71 patients. CD38+CD45RA+ double negative T cells phenotyping did not outcompete sFASL/vitaminB12 as most predictive biomarkers. Fifty-four patients had mostly autosomal-dominant autoimmune-lymphoproliferative immunodeficiencies (AD-ALPID) affecting JAK/STAT, CTLA4/LRBA, PI3K, NFkB or RAS signaling. Sixteen patients had somatic mutations. Nineteen had other IEI, 17 other diagnoses and 79 no diagnosis despite extended genetics (ALPID-U). Multivariate clustering of clinical and laboratory manifestations did not discriminate ALPID-U from AD-ALPID, but ALPID-U patients had later onset and 80% were male. Re-classification of patients fulfilling CVID or Evans syndrome criteria did not increase the proportion of genetic diagnoses.Conclusion: The ALPID phenotype defined here is enriched for patients with genetic diseases treatable with targeted therapies. The term ALPID may be useful to direct diagnostic and therapeutic efforts also for some children currently classified as CVID or Evans syndrome.Funding: This study was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft under Germany’s Excellence Strategy (CIBSS—EXC-21899—Project ID 390939984; SE), the SFB1160 (TPA08) and the BMBF-funded German Auto-Immunity Network (GAIN), grant code 197 01GM1910A (BG, SE, FH).

We present an approach that can save this effort and assess its query performance in a case study that reflects real-world scenarios.For data segregation, we used PostgreSQL’s row level security (RLS) feature, the unit test framework pgTAP for validation and testing as well as the i2b2 application. No change of the i2b2 code was required. Instead, to leverage orchestration and deployment, we additionally implemented a command line interface (CLI). We evaluated performance using 3 different queries generated by i2b2, which we performed on an enlarged Harvard demo dataset.We introduce the open source Python CLI i2b2rls, which orchestrates and manages security roles to implement data marts so that they do not need to be replicated and synchronized as different i2b2 projects. Our evaluation showed that our approach is on average 3.55 and on median 2.71 times slower compared to classic i2b2 data marts, but has more flexibility and easier setup.The RLS-based approach is particularly useful in a scenario with many projects, where data is constantly updated, user and group requirements change frequently or complex user authorization requirements have to be defined. The approach applies to both the i2b2 interface and direct database access.Today, data warehouses form the foundation of modern data science in all areas where insights are gained from data. In the medical and healthcare sector, these warehouses require data access rules. i2b2 is a prominent and widespread data warehouse software providing project specific data segregation and thus access management. However, i2b2’s current approach often involves data replication and synchronization, leading to significant effort. Based on the main components shipped within i2b2 and their features, we present a command line tool which orchestrates a new data segregation approach without the requirement of data replication which we released under MIT open source license. Additionally, we evaluated our approach’s performance using 3 different queries on a real-world warehouse scenario based on a pre-existent enlarged demo dataset of i2b2. Our evaluation showed that our approach is on average 3.55 and on median 2.71 times slower compared to classic i2b2 approach but has more flexibility and easier setup.

Management depends on disease evolution, but predictors of severe disease are lacking. Objectives Report the extended spectrum of disease manifestations in APDS1 versus APDS2, compare these to CTLA-4 deficiency, NFκB1 deficiency, and STAT3 gain-of-function (GOF) disease; identify predictors of severity in APDS. Methods Data collection with the European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID)-APDS registry. Comparison with published cohorts of the other IEIs. Results The analysis of 170 APDS patients outlines high penetrance and early-onset of APDS compared to the other IEIs. The large clinical heterogeneity even in individuals with the same PIK3CD variant E1021K illustrates how poorly the genotype predicts the disease phenotype and course. The high clinical overlap between APDS and the other investigated IEIs suggests relevant pathophysiological convergence of the affected pathways. Preferentially affected organ systems indicate specific pathophysiology: bronchiectasis is typical of APDS1; interstitial lung disease and enteropathy are more common in STAT3 GOF and CTLA-4 deficiency. Endocrinopathies are most frequent in STAT3 GOF, but growth impairment is also common particularly in APDS2. Early clinical presentation is a risk factor for severe disease in APDS. Conclusion APDS illustrates how a single genetic variant can result in a diverse autoimmune-lymphoproliferative phenotype. Overlap with other IEI is substantial. Some specific features distinguish APDS1 from APDS2. Early-onset is a risk factor for severe disease course calling for specific treatment studies in younger patients.","tags":["APDS","CTLA-4","ESID","IEI","immunodeficiency","NFκB1","PI3K","PIK3CD","PIK3R1","STAT3"],"title":"Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase δ Syndrome: Update from the ESID Registry and comparison with other autoimmune-lymphoproliferative inborn errors of immunity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Raphael Scheible","David Alkier","Justus Wendroth","Julian Mayer","Martin Boeker"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"91adcdc573350c1046afd02ebb3db6ab","permalink":"https://raphiniert.com/publication/scheible-fhir-2023/","publishdate":"2023-12-29T21:27:16.985409Z","relpermalink":"/publication/scheible-fhir-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"FHIR DataProvider for ReactAdmin: Leveraging User Interface Creation for Medical Web Applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Raphael Scheible","Stephan Rusch","Maria Elena Maccari","Markus G.

The introduction of Bidirectional Encoders for Transformers (BERT) and its optimized version RoBERTa have had significant impact and increased the relevance of pre-trained models. First, research in this field mainly started on English data followed by models trained with multilingual text corpora. However, current research shows that multilingual models are inferior to monolingual models. Currently, no German single language RoBERTa model is yet published, which we introduce in this work (GottBERT). The German portion of the OSCAR data set was used as text corpus. In an evaluation we compare its performance on the two Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks Conll 2003 and GermEval 2014 as well as on the text classification tasks GermEval 2018 (fine and coarse) and GNAD with existing German single language BERT models and two multilingual ones. GottBERT was pre-trained related to the original RoBERTa model using fairseq. All downstream tasks were trained using hyperparameter presets taken from the benchmark of German BERT. The experiments were setup utilizing FARM. Performance was measured by the $F_1$ score. GottBERT was successfully pre-trained on a 256 core TPU pod using the RoBERTa BASE architecture. Even without extensive hyper-parameter optimization, in all NER and one text classification task, GottBERT already outperformed all other tested German and multilingual models.

In the context of PID-NET data, we show how registries based on custom software can be made interoperable for better collaborative access to precollected data.  The Open Source Registry System for Rare Diseases ( Open-Source-Registersystem für Seltene Erkrankungen  [OSSE], in German) provides patient organizations, physicians, scientists, and other parties with open source software for the creation of patient registries. In addition, the necessary interoperability between different registries based on the OSSE, as well as existing registries, is supported, which allows those registries to be confederated at both the national and international levels. Objective:  Data from the PID-NET registry should be made available in an interoperable manner without losing data sovereignty by extending the existing custom software of the registry using the OSSE registry framework. Methods:  This paper describes the following: (1) the installation and configuration of the OSSE bridgehead, (2) an approach using a free toolchain to set up the required interfaces to connect a registry with the OSSE bridgehead, and (3) the decentralized search,  which allows the formulation of inquiries that are sent to a selected set of registries of interest. Results:  PID-NET uses the established and highly customized ESID registry software. By setting up a so-called OSSE bridgehead, PID-NET data are made interoperable according to a federated approach, and centrally formulated inquiries for data can be received. As the first registry to use the OSSE bridgehead, the authors introduce an approach using a free toolchain to efficiently implement and maintain the required interfaces. Finally, to test and demonstrate the system, two inquiries are realized using the graphical query builder. By establishing and interconnecting an OSSE bridgehead with the underlying ESID registry, confederated queries for data can be received and, if desired, the inquirer can be contacted to further discuss any requirements for cooperation. Conclusions:  The OSSE offers an infrastructure that provides the possibility of more collaborative and transparent research. The decentralized search functionality includes registries into one search application while still maintaining data sovereignty. The OSSE bridgehead enables any registry software to be integrated into the OSSE network. The proposed toolchain to set up the required interfaces consists of freely available software components that are well documented.

During my childhood, I adhered to Catholicism, regularly engaging in prayer and developing a keen sense of right and wrong. However, my early exposure to relationships and sexuality led me down a path of bad habits, drug use, and a quest for personal freedom. Despite achieving academic success, I grappled with inner emptiness and powerlessness.\nA dramatic motorcycle accident, which nearly claimed my life, served as a turning point. Despite a swift physical recovery, I struggled emotionally. In 2007, I embarked on a journey into Computer Science, but my personal life took a toll. A tumultuous relationship and an intense focus on environmentalism and politics drove me further into emptiness turning me into a anti-theist.\n  Me in my vegan lifestyle period in 2014.   Returning to Germany in 2013 after an accademic exchange year in Canada, I faced a breakup with my girl friend, followed by a supernatural moment. A chance encounter on the very same day led me to my future wife, a devout Christian, and through her, I began to experience God\u0026rsquo;s love. In 2016, after a period of introspection and spiritual exploration, I and my flatmate had an encounter with God. Consequently, I accepted Jesus as my Lord and Savior. This transformative experience brought about emotional healing, and I felt a profound sense of home and inner peace for the first time.\n  Wedding shooting in 2017. Before I encoutered God, I never wanted to marry or even wear a suite like that.   The subsequent years were marked by spiritual growth, baptism, and marriage in 2017. However, the journey wasn\u0026rsquo;t without challenges. Besides, God showed me that Satan and Demons exist, especially in a pivotal moment in 2018. Inspired by the Holy Spirit, I undertook a fast, and during an event by The Last Reformation, experienced deliverance from a lingering demon1. After a group of Christians prayed for me, with one scream something left me, after it tried to hold on my inner side of the back - a pretty strange moment. This encounter brought an unprecedented level of freedom, lifting a weight that had burdened me throughout my life.\nSince then, I\u0026rsquo;ve continued to evolve spiritually, navigating the lifelong adventure of self-discovery and alignment with God\u0026rsquo;s plan. Each step forward brings me closer to the person God intended me to be, gradually setting me free from the shackles of my past. God walked a path of inner healing with me. Jesus goes to the roots: he is constantly changing my heart and thus is changing me from the inside out. God encountered me repeatedly and regardless of my circumstances, I have freedom in my struggles and can always turn to him. As if I had been a tree far away in the desert, I am now provided by water that never runs dry2.\nYour Chance to Encounter God Encounter the living Jesus by seeking and eventually accepting Him as your God and Savior3. Faith is a decision, not just a belief. Jesus initiates faith, providing the Holy Spirit to restore your relationship with father God4. Acknowledge that you can\u0026rsquo;t save yourself by good deeds5; we all need the grace of God. He does not condem us, but came to rescue us. All he wants is a loving relationship with us that fills our hearts and blesses us so that we can leave the paths of destruction that Satan leads us down.\nWatch this short video for more information:   What Jesus did Jesus died for our sins, breaking the cycle of destructive \u0026ldquo;dead gods.\u0026rdquo; Sin, the root of evil, separates us from God and leads to spiritual death. This forms an infinite whole in our hearts, which we try to cope with in so many ways and which ultimately drives us to self-destruction and tyranny. Jesus, the one true God6, demonstrated unconditional love by dying for us, rising from the dead, and forgiving our sins. He payed our dept, as the wage of sin is death. Only the acceptance of Christ\u0026rsquo;s offering can re-establish our relationship to the living God who is the only one being able to fullfill our hearts. Apart from the present state, we live forever, and it is up to us to choose whether we want eternal life with God or separation from Him7 - so choose wisely.\n  You can ask Jesus now for forgiveness and invite the Holy Spirit into your life through a simple prayer. Pray aloud:\nJesus Christ, forgive my sins, come into my life, baptize me with the Holy Spirit. I accept you as my God and Savior. Transform me into an image of your perfect love, removing fear and darkness. Free me from any demonic powers, heal me and demonstrate me your unconditional love. Implement your heavenly kingdom into me! Amen.\nIf you prayed it, grow your relationship with God through prayer, reading the Bible, and water baptism. Seek guidance from The Last Reformation and find a local Bible-based church. Let God work in you and bring light to this world. Rest in His promise: Come to me, all who labor, and I will give you rest. My yoke is easy, and my burden is light8.\nIf you are not yet ready to make a decision, I definitely recommend that you seek the Lord. Pick up a Bible or read it online. Best, start with the New Testament. Have the courage to ask Jesus to show you his existence. Also, I highly recommend the Alpha Course to learn more about the Christian faith in a community which enables you to have direct conversations and ask questions. Finally, I pray that the Lord will reveal Himself to you.\nGod bless you!\n The Bible, Matthew 14:21 ^ The Bible, Johannes 4:14 ^ The Bible, Luke 11:9 ^ The Bible, Hebrews 12:2 ^ The Bible, Ephesians 2:8-9 ^ The Bible, John 14:6 ^ The Bible, Romans 6:23 ^ The Bible, Matthew 11:28-13 ^   ","date":1577566920,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577566920,"objectID":"47734519599918f2fd76e1a729191523","permalink":"https://raphiniert.com/jesus/","publishdate":"2019-12-28T22:02:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/jesus/","section":"","summary":"How I met the one and only living God","tags":["Godly encounter","Jesus Christ","Unconditional Love"],"title":"Spiritual Life","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Bioinformatics"],"content":"","date":1577555479,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577555479,"objectID":"47a2efa415310fe109a204c0410ea396","permalink":"https://raphiniert.com/project/miracum-pipe/","publishdate":"2019-12-28T18:51:19+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/miracum-pipe/","section":"project","summary":"Whole exome sequencing pipeline including advanced variant annotation features and automated PDF reporting.","tags":["Bioinformatics","Genetic Sequencing"],"title":"Miracum Pipe","type":"project"},{"authors":["Markus G.

The core application is implemented in C/C++. To guarantee fast computations the render process computes on the GPU. This is realized by NVIDIA® CUDA®. Furthermore Volume Renderer for use with MATLAB® provides the following features:\n Special memory management: Due to restricted GPU memory and the requirement to render more than one volume in one scene, we developed a special memory management to enable the rendering of huge data sets in separate rendering passes. Afterward these separately rendered images are combined to one image using MATLAB®. Generic illumination model: We developed a generic illumination model that is easy to extend with other illumination functions. The provided function is the Heneyey-Greenstein phase function. Stereo rendering: In some use cases there is a nice feature to work with stereo images. Thus, the renderer offers the possibility to render off-axis stereo images. High usability: To enable a high usability a MATLAB® interface consisting of several MATLAB® classes has been developed. Due to this interface it is uncomplicated to generate movies.  More detailed explanation of the renderer and its background can be found in the documentation in the download section. We provide this software only for 64 bit Linux systems.\nIt was developed by Raphael Scheible supervised by Benjamin Ummenhofer and Junior-Prof Dr. Olaf Ronneberger and is maintained by Raphael Scheible.\nRequirements  CUDA® capable NVIDIA® graphics device\n(at least Fermi™ architecture) Linux computer (64 bit) with installed NVIDIA® driver and CUDA® 4.2 MATLAB® (*)  * tested and developed under R2010a; might work from 2009a as the OOP feature was introduced the renderer uses.\nExample The following video demonstrates the power of the renderer.\nprovided by Benjamin Ummenhofer, data from [1]\n  Download  Documentation: documentation-1.0.pdf\nmd5sum: 5af53f26fe5965eb7ac9d69a2c0050be Software: vrm-1.0.tar.gz\nmd5sum: f324f09f3b7845876e5caf50a71b2f12  Installation Copy the files of src/matlab/ and bin/ into your current working folder. From this locationyou can now easily call the renderer.\nIf you want to compile src/HeneyeyGreenstein.cc by yourself, use themex command in your MATLAB® environment:\nmex inputfile -output resultname\nFor a more detailed explanation of the mex command visit this website .\nAlternatively, you can use the HG.mexa64.
