On the other side, I ever had issues with my sexuality and eventually fell into bad habbits at a very early age as child. Early I had several girlfriends and way too early I had my first sexual encounters. Further, I fell into drug habbits, smoked weed and always was looking for freedom in my heart. When I was under alcoholic influence, I was a moron and sometimes treated people very unfair und unloving. I further started to play guitar in a band called Demon Seed, later they renamed to <a href=https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Frozen_Infinity/81415 target=_blank>Frozen Infinity</a>. The athmosphere in the band sessions were, let&rsquo;s say, weired. I would say, we were a bunch of young guys dreaming of some success and playing at some events, which at least for me, never happened. I went to high-school, did my degree and just lived with my inner emptiness and powerlessness. In 2007 I did my Civil Service and in the last month of that life period
I had a dramatic motorcycle accident.</p><figure class=floatleft><a data-fancybox href=/img/hospital.jpg data-caption="In the intensive care unit of the University Hospital in Freiburg after a heavy motor cycle accident in 2007."><img data-src=/img/hospital.jpg class=lazyload alt></a><figcaption>In the intensive care unit of the University Hospital in Freiburg after a heavy motor cycle accident in 2007.</figcaption></figure><p>I nearly died and was very lucky to survive - a clear miracle. Nobody knew how I would end up. Anyhow, physical healing went incredibely fast. I instantly started to study Computer Science. My girlfriend at that time went on a US travel and I would say, I turned her trip to a real nightmare and hell on earth. Not intentionally, I just was so traumatized and something inside of me tormented me with a unnatural and completely unlogical fear of loosing her. In 2008 she quit the relationship, which was brutal to me. Consequently, I decided to start to train my body and to go into some healing process, i.e. psychologist sessions. On a tour to Padua in Italy, I remember myself sitting in a church, crying to God staring at the cross of Jesus. I wanted her back and it hurt so much and I wanted my emptyness to go away. Unfortunately, nothing happened into that direction. At the same time, I read the book <code>The Art of Loving</code> from Erich Fromm and afterwards I tried to start to love people out of myself. The effects were amazing, as relationsships grew. Unfortunately, I quickly went out of energy, out of love (the fuel of the human soul) and I turned to be a selfish, cold hearted human being in the proceeding years. I guess this was the turning point when <strong>I slowly decided that God does not exists</strong>. The society and humans started to piss me off and I hat much hatred inside my heart. I hoped to find freedom in another country. My new girlfriend and I decided to study abroad in Canada - but in different towns. She in Ottawa and I in Toronto. I lived outside of town. Here I was confronted with the hole in my heart and away from my usual life with my hole filling techniques were gone. Nothing seemed to help and consequently I got so depressed that I did not know what else to do. Blaming everybody and trying to grasp everything that could hold me, I wanted to travel back to Germany. But as I originally planned to travel around after the terms and my flat in Germany was sublet, I decided to stay in Canada and fight it through. After I changed the University to Kingston it became better, but still wasn&rsquo;t amazing. I was empty inside as never before and still did not know how to solve this issue. Sports didn&rsquo;t work, sex didn&rsquo;t work, concentrated working wasn&rsquo;t possible at all and drugs didn&rsquo;t solve this issue. Again I turned the life of my girlfriend into a nightmare. Consequently, she betrayed me when someone made her very drunk. I utterly wanted to forgive her, but I couldn&rsquo;t as cold hearted as I was. When we travelled around it was a pure nightmare for her, I would say.</p><p>When I came back to Germany in Summer 2013 after visiting a friend in Columbia, she broke up - understandably. It was a supernatural moment. When she broke up, I thought that I should cry and I tried in vain. Then I had sudden freedom and decided to get some food a bit farer away. I cycled there and met an old flatmate who invited me to come by for a beer. On the very same evening, I met my wife. She was and still is a strong follower of Jesus and on that evening had a special visitor - an evangelical pastor - and living in the old flat where I was living years before. My wife and I became best friends and God started to show me his love through her. Although I was still trying to get my ex-girlfriend back, she started to attract me and we eventually became a couple.
Futhermore, when I came back from Canada, I started to be <a href=https://www.badische-zeitung.de/raphael-schmitt-freiburg--84511999.html target=_blank>active in politics</a> as I thought, we must care more about this planet. This good intend went into an unhealthy extreme. I started to life vegan and judge other people for destroying the planet. My back then girlfriend and todays wife accompanied me on that path. Despite my good intentions, my heart became harder and harder. I did not care about myself very much and ran around in weird old clothings. For a period of time I even lived without a fridge. But all the effort I put into my lifestyle did not improve my inner status - no fulfillment, no peace, no freedom at all - quite the opposite.</p><figure class=floatright><a data-fancybox href=/img/vegan.png data-caption="Me in my vegan lifestyle period in 2014."><img data-src=/img/vegan.png class=lazyload alt></a><figcaption>Me in my vegan lifestyle period in 2014.</figcaption></figure><p>In 2016, a few weeks after my wife prayed to Jesus, that she cannot live like that anymore and seriously wanted to brake up, I accepted Jesus as my Lord and saviour (she didn&rsquo;t tell me about that prayer): On one day she invited my flatmate, an agnostic, to join her for church service. At that point I was an <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antitheism target=_blank>anti-theist</a>, convinced, that there is no God. I totally believed the idea that nothing created everything - which I can say as a scientist makes absolutely no sense. <strong>It is scientifically just impossible that nothing created everything. Further, I even did not accept the fact, that a human consists of soul, body and spirit.</strong> Furthermore, I was very narcistic and arrogant personality. I thought to have everything: nice girlfriend, good job and was convinced everything was going good in my life. Anyways, when my flatmate confirmed to join for church service, I decided to join as well. I joined them later at the <a href=https://cgfr.de target=_blank>church</a> when service already started. Entering the church I thought these people are insane: Singing and rasing their arms, like they&rsquo;re really feeling and something. Inside myself, everything was very dark and empty. When the preacher preached, I thought very arrogantly &ldquo;when he knew, what I know he would think differently&rdquo; because I was scientifecly very educated. At the end ot the service the pastor asked the crowd if someone wants to try Jesus. My friend raised his arm and so I did. We both went to the pastor and prayed a &ldquo;sinners prayer&rdquo;. When I spoke out, that I&rsquo;m a sinner I honestly thought in my heart &ldquo;indeed, I didn&rsquo;t do everything right&rdquo;. In the same night I had a very present dream, which was new to me. We started to follow Jesus, i.e. go to church services. Starting to read the Bible and things slowly changed inside of us. On one day, both of us had an extreme encounter with the holy spirit, when an apostle and a prophet of the church prayed for us. In my case, as I know today, back then I lost some demons. On that very day my friend and I knew, that Christ is Lord and the way to go. In my heart I suddenly arrived at some state I would call &ldquo;home&rdquo; and knew that I was looking for my entire life for that. The filling <strong>unconditional love</strong> that hit me the first time in that moment was so extrem and completely unearned. Funny fact: we were looking for truth, as we saw all the lies in the world. Final destination was the objective truth, which is a person, i.e. Jesus Christ: <code>Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me</code><sup class=footnote-ref id=fnref:John16-04><a href=#fn:John16-04>1</a></sup>. We completely didn&rsquo;t expect that. In August 2016 I became truly baptized, started to eat meet again and asked my wife to mary me. Continuing following Christ more and more I discovered his love, lost a lot of tears and got some of my emotions back. He furhter healed me from physical sicknesses and I didn&rsquo;t require that much sleep anymore (12h+ vs. 7-8h). Finally, in 2017 my wife and I married.</p><figure class=floatleft><a data-fancybox href=/img/wedding_shooting.jpg data-caption="Wedding shooting in 2017. Before I encoutered God, I never wanted to marry or even wearing a suite like that."><img data-src=/img/wedding_shooting.jpg class=lazyload alt></a><figcaption>Wedding shooting in 2017. Before I encoutered God, I never wanted to marry or even wearing a suite like that.</figcaption></figure><p>After my conversion to Jesus Christ, it wasn&rsquo;t all that easy, yet. I still suffered from various bad emotional outbreaks and was somehow manipulative.
In 2018 the holy spirit told me to fast a couple of days, i.e. only drink water and eat nothing, and so I did. At that time <a href=https://thelastreformation.com/ target=_blank>The Last Reformation</a> carried out an event in town and a friend of mine co-ordinated it. So I helped them as well, inviting people on the street to a cinema presentation of their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7iaTGXTEU0" target=_blank>movie</a>. In the evening of the that event, which was my second day fasting, a group of us went to a back yard and ate some pizza. Suddenly, the holy spirit started to work. People were freed from demons. After God worked through us (we touched somebody to pray, and he instantly fell on the ground), I had the feeling God wants to free me. When a couple of people prayed for me, i.e. commanding my demon out, the muscles on my entire back started to twist together as if someone inside or me was holding on it. With a loud shout the demon went out and I instantly felt freedom. I was astonished, as there was more freedom, than I already experienced. I felt like loosing tons of weight. After that experience again a lot changes in my life happened: I was able to grow in love, I heard God more clearly as the fear just went and I didn&rsquo;t had to constantly fight against my old nature anymore. The doubtful voices which were in my head, especially when God spoke to me, disappeared - I became free at the 5. May 2018! That demon was all my life inside of me - one that required fast and prayer as Jesus told us thousands of years ago: <code>Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting</code><sup class=footnote-ref id=fnref:Mat17-21><a href=#fn:Mat17-21>2</a></sup>. After being spiritual free, God started a process to work on my soul. I&rsquo;m still in this process and this seems to be lifelong adventure which sets me more and more free and makes me to the human God once planned me to be.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/gd-t6i2LTic style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Jesus is alive and you can encounter him. It is your decission to accept him as your God and saivor. You do not need to &ldquo;believe&rdquo; in the sense of hoping that it is true, what he did. He is the one who is going to start the faith as the Bible states it - but only by request. He gives you the holy spirit who re-establishes the relation to God the father. Faith in the Bible is &ldquo;trusting&rdquo; and therefore you need to know him - have a relationship, i.e. encounter him. Before my flatmate and I experienced God, we once said &ldquo;it would be nice to have that believe but we simply cannot believe it&rdquo;. That was very smart, as we humans even cannot believe out of our own as the Bible states. Therefore, it is a decission and makes it much easier and is based on maximal grace. It&rsquo;s a complete gift which we can request from Jesus:
<code>Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith</code><sup class=footnote-ref id=fnref:Heb12-2><a href=#fn:Heb12-2>3</a></sup>.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/mmRPSoDrrFU style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>How does it work? Jesus died, because we all sin (are morally far away from what the Bible defines as love). We lie, we steel, we use God&rsquo;s name in vain, are greedy, jealous, envy, proud, selfish and so forth. Therefore, we follow dead Gods based on success, harmony, safety, fun and reputation. These dead gods always want offering, that never suffices. They keep wanting more and more while destroying you. When we act against the moral law of God, it is called sin. Sin is the root of evil. Sin defiles our heart. Sin let&rsquo;s enter fear into our character as we lose our identity and purpose. The consequence of sin is death in the spirit and as God is spirit we are separated from him. God and sin is not compatible, it would lead to death through astonishment. Therefore, when sin entered the world, he had to seperate himself from us. The emptiness in our soul is the consequence. Apart from God, trying to fill this inner vacuum, we destroy ourselves, our loved ones and our surroundings.
This sounds very bad and it truly is. In this state, we are not capable to love unconditionally as Jesus Christ does. But the <strong>one and only living God</strong> is pure uncondontitional love and loves humanity so much, that he died for us and payed the fine. He became human in <strong>Jesus Christ</strong>. When he died completely sinless on the cross, he payed for everybody who accepts this perfect offering. In order to prove, that he is god, Jesus Christ raised from the dead. He is still alive and has the power to forgive and remove your sins. He can give you a new heart. Now there comes your chance: You can ask Jesus Christ right now for forgiveness and to fill you with the holy spirit by a simple prayer. Just speak out loud with your lips and your mouth the following words:</p><p><code>Jesus Christ, please forgive me all my sins and come into my life! Baptize me with the holy spirit and re-establish the relationship to my heavenly father. I accept you as my God and Saviour. Please make me to the human being you once planned me to be: an image of your perfect love. Please give me a new loving heart and remove all fear, hatred and darkness out of my life and free me now from every demonic power. In Jesus name - Amen.</code></p><p>Steps to grow your relationship with God are prayer (talk to him) and especially reading the <a href=https://www.bibleserver.com/ target=_blank>Bible</a>. I recommend to start with the New Testament. Next step is water baptism and I recommend to do it quick - it has some serious spiritual effects, trust me! You can contact somebody of <a href=https://map.thelastreformation.com/ target=_blank>The Last Reformation</a>. Also look for a local Bible based church that acknowledges Jesus Christ as God and saviour as it gives you guidance and spiritual protection. Jesus now gave you the power to see and overcome sin in your life, and most importantly to increase in love (as the Bible defines it) in order to become the human God once planned. God wants to restore you&rsquo;re heart and make you pulling heaven down to make this dark world a brighter place.</p><p>Now, it&rsquo;s the time to rest and let him do his work in you:</p><p><code>Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.
For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.
