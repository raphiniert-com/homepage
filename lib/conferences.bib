	abstract = {A significant portion of data in Electronic Health Records is only available as unstructured text, such as surgical or finding reports, clinical notes and discharge summaries. To use this data for secondary purposes, natural language processing ({NLP}) tools are required to extract structured information. Furthermore, for interoperable use, harmonization of the data is necessary. {HL}7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources ({FHIR}), an emerging standard for exchanging healthcare data, defines such a structured format. For German-language medical {NLP}, the tool Averbis Health Discovery ({AHD}) represents a comprehensive solution. {AHD} offers a proprietary {REST} interface for text analysis pipelines. To build a bridge between {FHIR} and this interface, we created a service that translates the communication around {AHD} from and to {FHIR}. The application is available under an open source license.},
