	abstract = {Background
Activated phosphoinositide-3-kinase ({PI}3K) δ Syndrome ({APDS}) is an inborn error of immunity ({IEI}) with infection susceptibility and immune dysregulation, clinically overlapping with other conditions. Management depends on disease evolution, but predictors of severe disease are lacking.
Objectives
Report the extended spectrum of disease manifestations in {APDS}1 versus {APDS}2, compare these to {CTLA}-4 deficiency, {NFκB}1 deficiency, and {STAT}3 gain-of-function ({GOF}) disease; identify predictors of severity in {APDS}.
Methods
Data collection with the European Society for Immunodeficiencies ({ESID})-{APDS} registry. Comparison with published cohorts of the other {IEIs}.
Results
The analysis of 170 {APDS} patients outlines high penetrance and early-onset of {APDS} compared to the other {IEIs}. The large clinical heterogeneity even in individuals with the same {PIK}3CD variant E1021K illustrates how poorly the genotype predicts the disease phenotype and course. The high clinical overlap between {APDS} and the other investigated {IEIs} suggests relevant pathophysiological convergence of the affected pathways. Preferentially affected organ systems indicate specific pathophysiology: bronchiectasis is typical of {APDS}1; interstitial lung disease and enteropathy are more common in {STAT}3 {GOF} and {CTLA}-4 deficiency. Endocrinopathies are most frequent in {STAT}3 {GOF}, but growth impairment is also common particularly in {APDS}2. Early clinical presentation is a risk factor for severe disease in {APDS}.
Conclusion
{APDS} illustrates how a single genetic variant can result in a diverse autoimmune-lymphoproliferative phenotype. Overlap with other {IEI} is substantial. Some specific features distinguish {APDS}1 from {APDS}2. Early-onset is a risk factor for severe disease course calling for specific treatment studies in younger patients.},

 abstract = {Lately, pre-trained language models advanced the field of natural language processing (NLP). The introduction of Bidirectional Encoders for Transformers (BERT) and its optimized version RoBERTa have had significant impact and increased the relevance of pre-trained models. First, research in this field mainly started on English data followed by models trained with multilingual text corpora. However, current research shows that multilingual models are inferior to monolingual models. Currently, no German single language RoBERTa model is yet published, which we introduce in this work (GottBERT). The German portion of the OSCAR data set was used as text corpus. In an evaluation we compare its performance on the two Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks Conll 2003 and GermEval 2014 as well as on the text classification tasks GermEval 2018 (fine and coarse) and GNAD with existing German single language BERT models and two multilingual ones. GottBERT was pre-trained related to the original RoBERTa model using fairseq. All downstream tasks were trained using hyperparameter presets taken from the benchmark of German BERT. The experiments were setup utilizing FARM. Performance was measured by the \$F_\1\\$ score. GottBERT was successfully pre-trained on a 256 core TPU pod using the RoBERTa BASE architecture. Even without extensive hyper-parameter optimization, in all NER and one text classification task, GottBERT already outperformed all other tested German and multilingual models. In order to support the German NLP field, we publish GottBERT under the AGPLv3 license.},

@article{scheible_enabling_2020,
 abstract = {Background:  The German Network on Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases (PID-NET) utilizes the European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID) registry as a platform for collecting data. In the context of PID-NET data, we show how registries based on custom software can be made interoperable for better collaborative access to precollected data.  The Open Source Registry System for Rare Diseases ( Open-Source-Registersystem für Seltene Erkrankungen  [OSSE], in German) provides patient organizations, physicians, scientists, and other parties with open source software for the creation of patient registries. In addition, the necessary interoperability between different registries based on the OSSE, as well as existing registries, is supported, which allows those registries to be confederated at both the national and international levels.
Objective:  Data from the PID-NET registry should be made available in an interoperable manner without losing data sovereignty by extending the existing custom software of the registry using the OSSE registry framework.
Methods:  This paper describes the following: (1) the installation and configuration of the OSSE bridgehead, (2) an approach using a free toolchain to set up the required interfaces to connect a registry with the OSSE bridgehead, and (3) the decentralized search,  which allows the formulation of inquiries that are sent to a selected set of registries of interest.
Results:  PID-NET uses the established and highly customized ESID registry software. By setting up a so-called OSSE bridgehead, PID-NET data are made interoperable according to a federated approach, and centrally formulated inquiries for data can be received. As the first registry to use the OSSE bridgehead, the authors introduce an approach using a free toolchain to efficiently implement and maintain the required interfaces. Finally, to test and demonstrate the system, two inquiries are realized using the graphical query builder. By establishing and interconnecting an OSSE bridgehead with the underlying ESID registry, confederated queries for data can be received and, if desired, the inquirer can be contacted to further discuss any requirements for cooperation.
Conclusions:  The OSSE offers an infrastructure that provides the possibility of more collaborative and transparent research. The decentralized search functionality includes registries into one search application while still maintaining data sovereignty. The OSSE bridgehead enables any registry software to be integrated into the OSSE network. The proposed toolchain to set up the required interfaces consists of freely available software components that are well documented. The use of the decentralized search is uncomplicated to use and offers a well-structured, yet still improvable, graphical user interface to formulate queries.

    abstract = "{i2b2 offers the possibility to store biomedical data of different projects in subject oriented data marts of the data warehouse, which potentially requires data replication between different projects and also data synchronization in case of data changes. We present an approach that can save this effort and assess its query performance in a case study that reflects real-world scenarios.For data segregation, we used PostgreSQL’s row level security (RLS) feature, the unit test framework pgTAP for validation and testing as well as the i2b2 application. No change of the i2b2 code was required. Instead, to leverage orchestration and deployment, we additionally implemented a command line interface (CLI). We evaluated performance using 3 different queries generated by i2b2, which we performed on an enlarged Harvard demo dataset.We introduce the open source Python CLI i2b2rls, which orchestrates and manages security roles to implement data marts so that they do not need to be replicated and synchronized as different i2b2 projects. Our evaluation showed that our approach is on average 3.55 and on median 2.71 times slower compared to classic i2b2 data marts, but has more flexibility and easier setup.The RLS-based approach is particularly useful in a scenario with many projects, where data is constantly updated, user and group requirements change frequently or complex user authorization requirements have to be defined. The approach applies to both the i2b2 interface and direct database access.Today, data warehouses form the foundation of modern data science in all areas where insights are gained from data. In the medical and healthcare sector, these warehouses require data access rules. i2b2 is a prominent and widespread data warehouse software providing project specific data segregation and thus access management. However, i2b2’s current approach often involves data replication and synchronization, leading to significant effort. Based on the main components shipped within i2b2 and their features, we present a command line tool which orchestrates a new data segregation approach without the requirement of data replication which we released under MIT open source license. Additionally, we evaluated our approach’s performance using 3 different queries on a real-world warehouse scenario based on a pre-existent enlarged demo dataset of i2b2. Our evaluation showed that our approach is on average 3.55 and on median 2.71 times slower compared to classic i2b2 approach but has more flexibility and easier setup. Our approach is particularly useful in a scenario with many projects, where data is constantly updated, user and group requirements change frequently or complex user authorization requirements have to be defined. The approach applies to both the i2b2 interface and direct database access.}",

	abstract = {The traditional manual recording of vaccination records in Germany faced challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, prompting the introduction of a COVID smartphone app with QR codes. However, this solution brought new challenges, emphasizing the need for a centrally managed European digital vaccination record for efficiency and validity. This study assesses the feasibility of using the HL7 FHIR standard in the healthcare industry for implementing a digital vaccination pass management and monitoring system. The system aims to offer convenience and improved efficiency for both patients and healthcare providers while promoting interoperability with other healthcare systems. To this end, we developed a prototype using modern technologies, such as React, Quarkus, and Keycloak. Results indicate potential benefits for patients and healthcare providers, offering access to immunization records, personalized recommendations, and streamlined management. However, integrating nuanced vaccination processes into the standardized FHIR system requires custom extensions, which might hinder interoperability. Manual data entry and the integration of an identity provider present further obstacles in industry scenarios. Despite these challenges, this study suggests that implementing HL7 FHIR can enhance efficiency, data accessibility, and accuracy in the vaccination process, supporting broader digitization efforts in the German healthcare system and beyond.},

    ABSTRACT = {Traditional tools, such as 3D Slicer, Fiji, and MATLAB®, often encounter limitations in rendering performance and data management as the dataset sizes increase. This work presents a GPU-enabled volume renderer with a MATLAB® interface that addresses these issues. The proposed renderer uses flexible memory management and leverages the GPU texture-mapping features of NVIDIA devices. It transfers data between the CPU and the GPU only in the case of a data change between renderings, and uses texture memory to make use of specific hardware benefits of the GPU and improve the quality. A case study using the ViBE-Z zebrafish larval dataset demonstrated the renderer’s ability to produce visualizations while managing extensive data effectively within the MATLAB® environment. The renderer is available as open-source software.},

    abstract="Background: The internet is a key source of health information, but the quality of content from popular search engines varies, posing challenges for users---especially those with low health or digital health literacy. To address this, the ``tala-med'' search engine was developed in 2020 to provide access to high-quality, evidence-based content. It prioritizes German health websites based on trustworthiness, recency, user-friendliness, and comprehensibility, offering category-based filters while ensuring privacy by avoiding data collection and advertisements. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the acceptance and usability of this independent, noncommercial search engine from the users' perspectives and their actual use of the search engine. Methods: For the questionnaire study, a cross-sectional study design was used. In total, 802 participants were recruited through a web-based panel and were asked to interact with the new search engine before completing a web-based questionnaire. Descriptive statistics and multiple regression analyses were used to assess participants' acceptance and usability ratings, as well as predictors of acceptance. Furthermore, from October 2020 to June 2021, we used the open-source web analytics platform Matomo to collect behavior-tracking data from consenting users of the search engine. Results: The study indicated positive findings on the acceptance and usability of the search engine, with more than half of the participants willing to reuse (465/802, 58{\%}) and recommend it (507/802, 63.2{\%}). Of the 802 users, 747 (93.1{\%}) valued the absence of advertising. Furthermore, 92.3{\%} (518/561), 93.9{\%} (553/589), 94.7{\%} (567/599), and 96.5{\%} (600/622) of those users who used the filters agreed at least partially that the filter functions were helpful in finding trustworthy, recent, user-friendly, or comprehensible results. Participants criticized some of the search results regarding the selection of domains and shared ideas for potential improvements (eg, for a clearer design). Regression analyses showed that the search engine was especially well accepted among older users, frequent internet users, and those with lower educational levels, indicating an effective targeting of segments of the population with lower health literacy and digital health literacy. Tracking data analysis revealed 1631 sessions, comprising 3090 searches across 1984 unique terms. Users performed 1.64 (SD 1.31) searches per visit on average. They prioritized the search terms ``corona,'' ``back pain,'' and ``cough.'' Filter changes were common, especially for recency and trustworthiness, reflecting the importance that users placed on these criteria. Conclusions: User questionnaires and behavior tracking showed the platform was well received, particularly by older and less educated users, especially for its advertisement-free design and filtering system. While feedback highlighted areas for improvement in design and filter functionality, the search engine's focus on transparency, evidence-based content, and user privacy shows promise in addressing health literacy and navigational needs. Future updates and research will further refine its effectiveness and impact on promoting access to quality health information. ",

abstract = {Abstract Immunocompromised individuals are at significantly elevated risk for severe courses of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In addition to vaccination, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) have been applied throughout the pandemic, with time of treatment onset and potency against the currently prevailing virus variant identified as relevant factors for medical benefit. Using data from the European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID) registry, the present study evaluated COVID-19 cases in three groups of patients with inborn errors of immunity (IEI; 981 agammaglobulinemia patients on immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IGRT); 8960 non-agammaglobulinemia patients on IGRT; 14 428 patients without IGRT), and the neutralizing capacity of 1100 immunoglobulin lots against SARS-CoV-2 (“Wuhan” and Omicron strains), throughout 3 years. From the first (2020/2021) to the second (2021/2022) cold season, i.e., during the virus drift to the more contagious Omicron variants, an increase in case numbers was recorded that was comparable (~2- to 3-fold) for all three study groups. During the same period, immunoglobulin lots showed a profound nAb increase against the archetypal SARS-CoV-2 strain, yet only low levels of Omicron nAbs. Notably, shortly before the third (2022/2023) cold season, Omicron-neutralizing capacity of released immunoglobulin lots had plateaued at high levels. From the second to the third cold season, COVID-19 cases dropped markedly. While a ~6-fold case reduction was recorded for the groups of non-agammaglobulinemia patients on IGRT and IEI patients not receiving IGRT, the decline was ~30-fold for the group of agammaglobulinemia patients on IGRT. These findings suggest a substantial COVID-19-protective effect of IGRT, at least for distinct groups of antibody-deficient patients.},

	abstract = {Background: Digital healthcare generates vast amounts of clinical texts thathold potential for AI-assisted applications. However, existing German biomedicallanguage models either rely on older architectures or are trained on limited data,which may hinder their performance in real-world settings.
Methods: To explore the impact of domain adaptation strategies in Germanclinical NLP, we developed a family of domain-specific RoBERTa-based languagemodels, collectively referred to as ChristBERT (Clinical- and Healthcare-Related Issues and Subjects Tuned BERT). To address the lack of large-scaleGerman clinical corpora, we curated a 13.5 GB dataset consisting of scientificpublications, clinical texts, and health-related web content. Additionally, weemployed data augmentation via translation of English clinical corpora. Threedomain adaptation strategies were explored: continued pre-training, pre-trainingfrom scratch, and pre-training with domain-specific vocabulary adaptation.
Results: The resulting models were evaluated on three medical named entityrecognition and two text classification tasks. Our models consistently outper-formed four existing general-purpose and medical German models on four out offive tasks. The results demonstrate that the choice of domain adaptation strat-egy significantly influences downstream task performance. Based on the empirical results, pre-training from scratch is effective for highly specialized clinical texts,whereas continued pre-training is suited for more commonly written medicaltexts.
Conclusions: ChristBERT establishes a new state-of-the-art for German clinicallanguage modeling. Our findings indicate that the optimal domain adaptationstrategy is task-dependent and remains crucial, as adapted models consistentlyoutperformed general-purpose language models in our experiments. To supportfurther research and application in German medical NLP, all developed modelsare publicly released.},
