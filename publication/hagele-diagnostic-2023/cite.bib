 abstract = {Background: Lymphoproliferation and autoimmune cytopenias characterize autoimmune-lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS). Other conditions sharing these manifestations have been termed “ALPS-like”, although they are frequently more severe. Insufficient information on the genetic, clinical and immunological features of these disorders renders their diagnostic classification and treatment difficult.Methods: We performed a 14-year prospective study on 431 children referred for ALPS evaluation with lymphoproliferation and autoimmune cytopenia (n=236), lymphoproliferation and another sign of an inborn error of immunity (SoIEI) (n=148), or (bi)-autoimmune cytopenia and SoIEI (n=47). ALPS biomarkers were determined in all. Sequencing depth was recommended by the study team and IEI panel, exome or genome sequencing were performed as decided by the treating physician in 240 patients.Results: ALPS was diagnosed in 71 patients. CD38+CD45RA+ double negative T cells phenotyping did not outcompete sFASL/vitaminB12 as most predictive biomarkers. Fifty-four patients had mostly autosomal-dominant autoimmune-lymphoproliferative immunodeficiencies (AD-ALPID) affecting JAK/STAT, CTLA4/LRBA, PI3K, NFkB or RAS signaling. Sixteen patients had somatic mutations. Nineteen had other IEI, 17 other diagnoses and 79 no diagnosis despite extended genetics (ALPID-U). Multivariate clustering of clinical and laboratory manifestations did not discriminate ALPID-U from AD-ALPID, but ALPID-U patients had later onset and 80% were male. Re-classification of patients fulfilling CVID or Evans syndrome criteria did not increase the proportion of genetic diagnoses.Conclusion: The ALPID phenotype defined here is enriched for patients with genetic diseases treatable with targeted therapies. The term ALPID may be useful to direct diagnostic and therapeutic efforts also for some children currently classified as CVID or Evans syndrome.Funding: This study was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft under Germany’s Excellence Strategy (CIBSS—EXC-21899—Project ID 390939984; SE), the SFB1160 (TPA08) and the BMBF-funded German Auto-Immunity Network (GAIN), grant code 197 01GM1910A (BG, SE, FH).
