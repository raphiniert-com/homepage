	abstract = {Background
Activated phosphoinositide-3-kinase ({PI}3K) δ Syndrome ({APDS}) is an inborn error of immunity ({IEI}) with infection susceptibility and immune dysregulation, clinically overlapping with other conditions. Management depends on disease evolution, but predictors of severe disease are lacking.
Objectives
Report the extended spectrum of disease manifestations in {APDS}1 versus {APDS}2, compare these to {CTLA}-4 deficiency, {NFκB}1 deficiency, and {STAT}3 gain-of-function ({GOF}) disease; identify predictors of severity in {APDS}.
Methods
Data collection with the European Society for Immunodeficiencies ({ESID})-{APDS} registry. Comparison with published cohorts of the other {IEIs}.
Results
The analysis of 170 {APDS} patients outlines high penetrance and early-onset of {APDS} compared to the other {IEIs}. The large clinical heterogeneity even in individuals with the same {PIK}3CD variant E1021K illustrates how poorly the genotype predicts the disease phenotype and course. The high clinical overlap between {APDS} and the other investigated {IEIs} suggests relevant pathophysiological convergence of the affected pathways. Preferentially affected organ systems indicate specific pathophysiology: bronchiectasis is typical of {APDS}1; interstitial lung disease and enteropathy are more common in {STAT}3 {GOF} and {CTLA}-4 deficiency. Endocrinopathies are most frequent in {STAT}3 {GOF}, but growth impairment is also common particularly in {APDS}2. Early clinical presentation is a risk factor for severe disease in {APDS}.
Conclusion
{APDS} illustrates how a single genetic variant can result in a diverse autoimmune-lymphoproliferative phenotype. Overlap with other {IEI} is substantial. Some specific features distinguish {APDS}1 from {APDS}2. Early-onset is a risk factor for severe disease course calling for specific treatment studies in younger patients.},

	abstract = {Background: Lymphoproliferation and autoimmune cytopenias characterize autoimmune-lymphoproliferative syndrome ({ALPS}). Other conditions sharing these manifestations have been termed “{ALPS}-like”, although they are frequently more severe. Insufficient information on the genetic, clinical and immunological features of these disorders renders their diagnostic classification and treatment difficult.Methods: We performed a 14-year prospective study on 431 children referred for {ALPS} evaluation with lymphoproliferation and autoimmune cytopenia (n=236), lymphoproliferation and another sign of an inborn error of immunity ({SoIEI}) (n=148), or (bi)-autoimmune cytopenia and {SoIEI} (n=47). {ALPS} biomarkers were determined in all. Sequencing depth was recommended by the study team and {IEI} panel, exome or genome sequencing were performed as decided by the treating physician in 240 patients.Results: {ALPS} was diagnosed in 71 patients. {CD}38+{CD}45RA+ double negative T cells phenotyping did not outcompete {sFASL}/{vitaminB}12 as most predictive biomarkers. Fifty-four patients had mostly autosomal-dominant autoimmune-lymphoproliferative immunodeficiencies ({AD}-{ALPID}) affecting {JAK}/{STAT}, {CTLA}4/{LRBA}, {PI}3K, {NFkB} or {RAS} signaling. Sixteen patients had somatic mutations. Nineteen had other {IEI}, 17 other diagnoses and 79 no diagnosis despite extended genetics ({ALPID}-U). Multivariate clustering of clinical and laboratory manifestations did not discriminate {ALPID}-U from {AD}-{ALPID}, but {ALPID}-U patients had later onset and 80\% were male. Re-classification of patients fulfilling {CVID} or Evans syndrome criteria did not increase the proportion of genetic diagnoses.Conclusion: The {ALPID} phenotype defined here is enriched for patients with genetic diseases treatable with targeted therapies. The term {ALPID} may be useful to direct diagnostic and therapeutic efforts also for some children currently classified as {CVID} or Evans syndrome.Funding: This study was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft under Germany’s Excellence Strategy ({CIBSS}—{EXC}-21899—Project {ID} 390939984; {SE}), the {SFB}1160 ({TPA}08) and the {BMBF}-funded German Auto-Immunity Network ({GAIN}), grant code 197 01GM1910A ({BG}, {SE}, {FH}).
