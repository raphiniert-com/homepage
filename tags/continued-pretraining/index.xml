&lt;p>ChristBERT was developed as part of my Master’s thesis and focuses on domain-specific German clinical language modeling. The project investigated two complementary strategies: continued pre-training on top of GottBERT/GeistBERT, and training from scratch using both a general-purpose RoBERTa tokenizer and a specialized medical vocabulary. This enabled a systematic comparison between general, domain-adapted, and fully specialized pre-training pipelines for German medical NLP.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the early conceptual phase, the supervision structure of the thesis changed, and the project was reassigned to a new advisor, who later became the supervisor of my doctoral work. ChristBERT was trained using a combination of compute resources: through an existing project partnership, parts of the full pre-training were executed on the Augsburg compute cluster, while downstream evaluations, and parts of the translation workflows ran on privately built GPU hardware in my basement.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ChristBERT showed that continued pre-training on German clinical text offers measurable improvements over general-purpose RoBERTa models, while training from scratch with a medical-specific tokenizer provides additional insights into domain vocabulary specialization and its trade-offs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The work has been released as a preprint and is currently under review at BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>GeistBERT was created during one of the most turbulent and defining phases of my doctoral work. AFollowing a supervisor transition at TUM, access to the compute environment I previously used was no longer available, so I migrated the entire evaluation workflow to my own workstation. What could have halted the project entirely instead became a turning point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With no cluster access, I migrated the full evaluation pipeline into my basement and ran it on a self-built workstation with two RTX 3090 GPUs in SLI. Every downstream task was completed entirely on private hardware. Constraints turned into autonomy, and the work slowly took shape.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At that time, the plan was more ambitious:&lt;br>
we intended to train Longformer- and Nyströmformer-based variants of GottBERT to compare sparse-attention architectures in continued pre-training on a GPU setup. However, an unnoticed mistake in the pre-training made these large-scale models useless. Instead of releasing partially flawed or inconclusive models, we made the conscious decision to retract the extended architectures and focus the paper on a clean, well-defined contribution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The final version of GeistBERT therefore centered on what was both scientifically solid and practically valuable:&lt;br>
a robust RoBERTa-base model with continued pre-training, using Whole Word Masking and a large, diverse corpus, carefully evaluated across standard German NLP benchmarks.&lt;br>
Despite being a base model, GeistBERT achieved state-of-the-art performance in multiple tasks and approached, and in some benchmarks even surpassed, the performance of existing large models.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During this phase, GeistBERT also revealed an interesting methodological insight:&lt;br>
unlike earlier TPU-based experiments, the GPU training workflow allowed for a substantially higher peak learning rate without instability. This raised new research questions about whether the stability originated from implementation differences in the GPU stack, or whether it was a characteristic of continued pre-training itself. These observations gave the project an additional scientific dimension beyond the model alone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The manuscript was completed far from Germany, during a research stay on the Azores, and released as a pre-print. Later, GeistBERT found its academic platform at &lt;a href="https://globalnlp2025.github.io">GlobalNLP2025@RANLP 2025&lt;/a> in Varna, Bulgaria.&lt;/p>
